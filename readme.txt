I, Suman Giri, have independently completed a drawing app project using Java in NetBeans. Drawing upon my programming skills and knowledge, I took the provided code structure and tailored it to suit my project's needs. I incorporated essential features to enable users to draw freehand, choose colors, adjust brush sizes, and clear their creations. Throughout the development journey, I kept in mind the project's constraints and brainstormed potential enhancements to ensure the creation of a user-friendly and efficient drawing application. My dedication and hard work have culminated in a functional drawing app that fulfills the objectives of my project.
